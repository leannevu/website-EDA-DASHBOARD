As I transition from Computer Science to Data Science, I wanted to deepen my understanding of exploratory data analysis while building user-focused tools. I created an interactive EDA Dashboard using Python (Flask, Pandas, Matplotlib)

# website-EDA-DASHBOARD
Analysis vs Productivity

Epic – 
As a user, I want to see both code and results as text or visual insights, displayed in a format similar to Jupyter Notebook.

    Story - 
    As a user, I want syntax highlighting that mirrors Jupyter’s color scheme
    As a user, I want line breaks and indentation to match how they appear in Jupyter
    As a user, I can click through different graph sections to interactively explore visual insights.

Epic – 
As a user, I want a guided and intuitive experience throughout the data analysis process

    Story -
    As a user, I can follow the EDA process step by step, presented as a walkthrough.
    As a user, I want the interface to clearly separate code from results and label insights meaningfully.
    As a user, I want consistent navigation and color-coding across all sections for a smoother experience.
    As a user, I want access to a detailed EDA journal that documents how each insight was derived.
