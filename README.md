# website-EDA-DASHBOARD

As I transition from Computer Science to Data Science, I wanted to deepen my understanding of exploratory data analysis while building user-focused tools. I created an interactive EDA Dashboard using Python (Flask, Pandas, Matplotlib) that allows users to upload CSV files, view insights instantly, and interact with their own data through a clean, responsive interface.

Epic – As a user, I want to see the code displayed like it would from Jupyter
As a user, I want to see different colors in the same placement as Jupyter would display it
As a user, I want new lines in the same placement as Jupyter would display it

Epic – As a user, I want to see visual insights and results from Jupyter
Story:
As a user, I can view correlation heatmaps
As a user, I can see histograms for any numerical column
As a user, I can click through different graph sections to understand the data visually

Epic – As a user, I want a guided and intuitive experience:
As a user, I can follow the EDA process step-by-step like a walkthrough
As a user, I want the interface to clearly label insights and separate code from results
As a user, I want consistent navigation and color-coding across sections for clarity
